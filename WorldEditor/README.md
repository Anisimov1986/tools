FOnline WorldEditor Source
========
WorldEditor is an editor for the FOnline engine, created to make the development process more accessible and faster. It was long developed as an internal tool exclusive to the FOnline: 2238 team, but is now released to the greater public.

The editor is capable of parsing almost all of the serverside gamedata used with the FOnline engine and makes editing of the worldmap very easy. No in-depth knowledge is required of most of files, and with the powerful scripting engine which utilizes C#, more useful utilities can be added quickly and with less effort than in a conventional scripting languge. It's even possible to make your extension scripts, scriptable!
